    "# Introduction to high density region plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on four main steps: \n",
    "* Dimension reduction: we project the curve sample onto the Karhunen-Loève basis, so that each curve is represented by a low dimension vector,\n",
    "* Distribution fitting: we estimate the distribution of the curves in the reduced space with, e.g., a kernel smoothing estimator,\n",
    "* Compute high density regions: we compute the minimum volume level sets of given volumes $\\alpha$ in the reduced space and identify outlier points,\n",
    "* Project back in the physical space: we visualize the outlier curves depending on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep the analysis simple, using 2 components for the Karhunen-Loève is a good starting point. This may, however, not be sufficient to correctly represent the information of the curve sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a set of curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/elnino-TrajectoryPlot.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset output is considered as a matrix where each line corresponds to a\n",
    "sample. \n",
    "This matrix is decomposed by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Karhunen-Loève decomposition.\n",
    "When the grid is regular, all three definitions are equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modes are ordered by decreasing importance in terms of contribution to the\n",
    "variance and only a finite number of modes are kept. In this reduced space,\n",
    "the functional dataset of large dimensions is conveniently represented by a\n",
    "limited number of scalars mapped onto most significant directions that maximizes\n",
    "the variance of the response variable. Within this reduced space, the\n",
    "classification of different patterns or the computation of metrics is eased.\n",
    "Hence, within this reduced space, the median sample corresponds to\n",
    "the HDR location. The distance to this point is computed in the modal space;\n",
    "the further a point is from the HDR, the less probable is the sample. The term\n",
    "*median*, which is used in the literature, is restrictive if there are multiple\n",
    "clusters of point in the reduced space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multivariate Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique is used to estimate\n",
    "the PDF $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{x})$ of this multivariate space. From this KDE, the\n",
    "HDR reads\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{R}_\\alpha = \\left\\{\\mathbf{x}: \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq f_{\\alpha} \\right\\},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{\\alpha}$ is such that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{\\mathcal{R}_\\alpha} \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{x}) d \\mathbf{x} = 1 - \\alpha.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this definition, the HDR corresponds to the region of highest PDF with a\n",
    "cumulative probability of $1-\\alpha$. By construction a HDR develops\n",
    "around the maximum PDF $\\max \\left\\{\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\right\\}$ which defines\n",
    "the mode. Transposed using the inverse transform from the reduced\n",
    "space to the original space, this most probable mode corresponds to the\n",
    "\"central curve\", also referred to as the *mode curve*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Except if the response variable of the system of interest is chaotic under the\n",
    "perturbation of its input parameters, the POD is expected to drastically reduce\n",
    "the dimensionality of the problem. Furthermore, as the system's response\n",
    "variable is also expected to oscillate around some modes, the points in the\n",
    "reduced space are likely to be relatively clustered around the modes. This\n",
    "mitigates the difficulty of the density estimation procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/elnino-scatter.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure illustrates the El Niño dataset in the reduced space when only two\n",
    "modes are retained ensuring that at least 80% of the response variable variance\n",
    "is conserved. This visualization exhibit a cluster of points. It indicate that\n",
    "a lot of curve lead to common components. Following a KDE is computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/elnino-DensityPlot.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Each realization can be characterized with respect to the HDR metric.\n",
    "In the modal space, each dot represents a realization within the dataset and\n",
    "the contouring represents the 50% and 80% quantiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the response variable physical space, the outliers are *red curves*,\n",
    "the *thick black curve* is the mode and the *blue area* represents\n",
    "80% quantiles envelopes. It should be noted that additional realizations with\n",
    "chosen characteristics on the outputs could be drawn by sampling the input for\n",
    "specific HDR criteria.\n",
